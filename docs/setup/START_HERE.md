## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is S3?

Amazon S3 is cloud storage. Your website files live here.

### What is CloudFront?

AWS's CDN (Content Delivery Network). Makes your site fast globally.

### What is ACM?

AWS Certificate Manager. Provides free SSL certificates for HTTPS.

### What is GitHub Actions?

Automated workflows that deploy your site when you push code.

### Why Cloudflare DNS?

You already have your domain there. We'll just point it to AWS.

## 🔄 Daily Workflow (After Setup)

Once everything is set up, updating your portfolio is easy:

```bash
# 1. Create a branch
git checkout -b update-projects

# 2. Edit files
code src/data/projects.json

# 3. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new project"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin update-projects
# Create PR on GitHub

# 5. Merge PR
# Click "Merge" on GitHub

# 6. Wait 2-3 minutes
# Your site updates automatically!
```
